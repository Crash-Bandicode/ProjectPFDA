Simulates dataset based on habits of smokers and effects on health.

# An Investigation into the effects of smoking:

Here I investigate the effects of smoking on the Irish population as a whole, and then attempt to simulate a small dataset of 100 samples that will hopefully reflect a real-world sample of the same size if one was to compare the two.

I was not working with any given dataset, hence I had to research information from a variety of sources and try and develop my own dataset from which I could work. 

Some limitations to my ability to more accurately simulate the data were my limited understanding of statistics when it came to un-symmetrical distributions or limited information regarding a distribution. I think I did a relatively good job of compensating for this lacking without sacrificing too much accuracy.

The other issue was that no matter how much time and effort I put in, I simply could not get a seed function to replicate the same results for my notebook repeatedly. I was able to seed other algorithms, and even copied other peoples code in to try and help, but to no avail. As a result, the data generated when you open the notebook may be a different example of a dataset than the one you see in the CSV file, however if you would really like to verify the variables on another generation of data there is the option of manually inputting the new arrays into the CSV file, although I can’t say I recommend it…

### Sns plot at end takes quite a while to load. It also gives a warning message, but it still works. If it takes too long you can remove the hue, although it takes fromthe final product.
